Style is first and foremost there to create readable and undestableable code.
Perfect for coming back to it in the near future and doing maintenance or updates.
Easy readability is measured by you and your team.
The best way to achieve it is to follow standards
while still experimenting with better ways to express yourself.
Make coding standards your baseline and advance from there.



#************************************************************************************
# 01. STYLE load
#************************************************************************************
Update the style of this module: arload.py
Use what you have learned.





#************************************************************************************
# 02. STYLE logger
#************************************************************************************
Update the style of this module: pylogger.py
Focus on readability of the function without the need to understand every part.
It should be easy for everyone to pick it up and modify it.





#************************************************************************************
# 03. LESS loops/ifs/calls
#************************************************************************************
a) Update compress_ifs.py in terms of the 'if' uses and style rules.

b) Find a module in your application with a lot of ifs, loops or function calls.
   See if you can update it in a way that needs significantly less lines of code.

TIP: Calls or ifs can often be replaced with loops.

see compress_ifs_edited.py



#************************************************************************************
# 04. STYLE module
#************************************************************************************
Update the style of your current application.
Look at the differences after you've finished: Before vs after.
Does it look and feel better and easier to read?


See the textureimporter folder







#************************************************************************************
# 05. DOCUMENTATION
#************************************************************************************
Write an advanced documentation on the remote git Wiki for your application.
e.g. https://github.com/alexanderrichtertd/plex/wiki

Include two documentation pages in your Wiki:

One for
a) an artist who wants to use the tool.
   Make it visual with images, gifs and even videos.

b) and one for a developer who wants to modify your module.
   Make its how-to and ins and outs clear.

NOTE: You can also upload a README.md file to the root.
      (If your current Github/... plan doesn't inlcude a private Wiki)




Mark Twain once said:
“I didn't have time to write a short letter,
so I wrote a long one instead.”

Mark Twain suggested that writing a hundred words requires more mental effort than writing a thousand
— particularly if you want it to be meaningful.
Don't waste your readers' time by writing things without a clear motivation.
Each line must count and help with a particular step or question.
Don’t be afraid of revisions and ask others for feedback.
